This is a React Native example app that uses [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job) to write both a timestamp and the results of a bluetooth scan every 10 seconds to a Redux store. The [react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) package is used for Bluetooth scanning.

**As shown in the screenshot below, if the app loses focus, the 10 second timestamp messages continue but the Bluetooth Scanning stops**

This sample app uses the `allowExecutionInForeground` option which is not recommended but even if this option is disabled, the background bluetooth scanning does not run. I note that [vikeri](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/issues/63) uses a setInterval while in the foreground and relies on react-native-background-job to run bluetooth scanning while in the background.

## Try it Out

```
git clone https://github.com/rgstephens/RNBackgroundJobBLE.git
yarn
react-native link
npm start
react-native run-android
```

## Interval Method

- [x] Uses [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job)
- [ ] Simple setInterval
- [x] option to start Foreground Service

## Action Performed at Each 10 Second Interval

- [x] Writes timestamp to Redux store
- [x] Calls bluetoothScan from [react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx) for devices
- [ ] Calls bluetoothScan from [react-native-background-timer](https://github.com/ocetnik/react-native-background-timer)

The `react-native init` [command](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) was used to create the initial project and the [react-native-create-library](https://github.com/frostney/react-native-create-library) tool was used as a start for the foreground service.

As of this writing, there are multiple approaches to get the timer to continue when the app runs in the background on Android:

* Run any **Android Foreground Service**.  I've found that this doesn't work. The react-native-background-job package tried using a Foreground Service and found it to be [unstable](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/issues/39) so it was removed from the 2.x version. On the official React Native [pain points site](https://react-native.canny.io), Anthony Benkhebbab [suggests](https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests/p/background-timer-execution) that running a Foreground Service using Android API > 23 will work but I have not found this to be the case.
* Run a native **Android [AlarmManager]((https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android.html#sending-events-to-javascript))** that sends a message to the JS side at a specified interval. This approach is used by [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job).  It also only executes your task when the app is in the background.  
* Use the [Firebase JobDispatcher](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android) which is also used by [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job)
* Use the new React Native [Headless JS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) but this is limited to running your task every 15 minutes. It also only executes your task when the app is in the background.

Some have suggested [react-native-background-timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-background-timer) but I have not looked into this yet.


## Main Component

The app starts a loop that runs every 10 seconds and displays the elapsed time (should be 10 seconds). The loop pushes a timestamp into the Redux store which is read and displayed by the main component. There's a switch at the top of the screen to enable/disable the foreground service. You'll see the Android Foreground Service notification confirming that it is running.
