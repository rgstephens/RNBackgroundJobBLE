This is a React Native example app that uses [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job) to write a timestamp every 10 seconds to a Redux store.

The `react-native init` [command](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) was used to create the initial project and the [react-native-create-library](https://github.com/frostney/react-native-create-library) tool was used as a start for the foreground service.

As of this writing, there are multiple approaches to get the timer to continue when the app runs in the background on Android:

* Run any **Android Foreground Service**.  I've found that this doesn't work. The react-native-background-job package tried using a Foreground Service and found it to be [unstable](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/issues/39) so it was removed from the 2.x version. On the official React Native [pain points site](https://react-native.canny.io), Anthony Benkhebbab [suggests](https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests/p/background-timer-execution) that running a Foreground Service using Android API > 23 will work but I have not found this to be the case.
* Run a native **Android [AlarmManager]((https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android.html#sending-events-to-javascript))** that sends a message to the JS side at a specified interval. This approach is used by [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job).  It also only executes your task when the app is in the background.  
* Use the [Firebase JobDispatcher](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android) which is also used by [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job)
* Use the new React Native [Headless JS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) but this is limited to running your task every 15 minutes. It also only executes your task when the app is in the background.

Some have suggested [react-native-background-timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-background-timer) or [react-native-background-job](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job) but these have other limitations. 


## Main Component

The app starts a loop that runs every 10 seconds and displays the elapsed time (should be 10 seconds). The loop pushes a timestamp into the Redux store which is read and displayed by the main component. There's a switch at the top of the screen to enable/disable the foreground service. You'll see the Android Foreground Service notification confirming that it is running.

## Try it Out!
